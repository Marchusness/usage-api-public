# Get Usage
It is recommended to only use this method for showing real time information to the user, eg. on a dashboard. When getting usage data to bill a user use the webhook.

```ts
import { getUsage } from "usage-api";

const startDate: Date;
const endDate: Date;

const res = getUsage(process.env.USAGE_API_KEY, {
    usageStoreId: "my-usage-store-id", // required
    dateSelection: { // required
        startDate: startDate.toISOString(), // required, must be before endDate, must be iso string
        endDate: endDate.toISOString() // required, must be after startDate, must be iso string
        // the difference between startDate and endDate must be less than 7 days or 168 hours
    } | {
        exactHour: startDate.toISOString() // required, must be iso string
    } | {
        pastHours: 24 // required, must be greater than 1 and less than 168
    }
});

type GetUsageResponse = {
    success: true,
    usage: {
        hourStartTimestamp: number;
        blocked: number;
        rateLimited: number;
        unauthenticated: number;
        auth: number;
        recorded: number;
        usageRecords: Record<string, number>;
    }[]
} | {
    success: false,
    message: string
}
```
